Description: pbdBASE gives higher packages, like pbdDMAT, access to 
        low-level scalable Fortran routines. The package consists of a
        set of ScaLAPACK wrappers, as well as a host of new C and 
        Fortran code.  
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux, Mac, and
        FreeBSD. MS-MPI (Microsoft HPC Pack 2012) or MPICH2 (>=
        1.4.1p1) on Windows.
