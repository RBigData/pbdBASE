Description: An interface to and extensions for the 'PBLAS' and
    'ScaLAPACK' numerical libraries.  This enables R to utilize
    distributed linear algebra for codes written in the 'SPMD' fashion.
    This interface is deliberately low-level and mimics the style of
    the native libraries it wraps.  For a much higher level way of
    managing distributed matrices, see the 'pbdDMAT' package.
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux, Mac, and
    FreeBSD. MS-MPI (Microsoft HPC Pack 2012) or MPICH2 (>= 1.4.1p1)
    on Windows.
